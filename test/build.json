Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:\nAmos' Bow: </b>Amos is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.\n<b>Hamayumi: </b>This weapon doesn't synergize well with Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) due to its passive.\n<b>Prototype Crescent: </b>At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\n<b>Regarding Talent Priority:\n</b>Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.\n\n","name":"MELT DPS"},{"recommended":true,"weapons":[{"id":"polar_star"},{"id":"aqua_simulacra"},{"id":"thundering_pulse"},{"id":"skyward_harp"},{"id":"amos_bow"},{"id":"prototype_crescent"},{"id":"blackcliff_warbow"},{"id":"hamayumi"}],"artifacts":[["blizzard_strayer"],["blizzard_strayer","+18%_atk_set"]],"mainStats":{"sands":["ATK%"],"goblet":["Cryo DMG"],"circlet":["Crit DMG"]},"subStats":["Crit Rate / DMG","ATK%","Energy Recharge","Flat ATK"],"talent":["Burst","Normal Attack","Skill"],"tip":"Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate) since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent Blooms.","note":"<b></b>Freeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.<b>\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: \nPolar Star: </b>This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly <b>(i.e. very little Crit Rate substats)</b>, it pulls quite far ahead of all the other options.<b>\nAqua Simulacra: </b>Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself, you can consider running an ATK% circlet, especially if it has better substats than your Crit DMG one.\n<b>Amos' Bow:</b> In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.\n<b>Prototype Crescent: </b>Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): </b>This set is the go to set for a Frozen team comp due to the huge stats it provides.<b>\n</b>","name":"FREEZE DPS"},{"recommended":false,"weapons":[{"id":"thundering_pulse"},{"id":"skyward_harp"},{"id":"polar_star"},{"id":"amos_bow"},{"id":"alley_hunter"},{"id":"the_stringless"},{"id":"prototype_crescent"},{"id":"blackcliff_warbow"},{"id":"the_viridescent_hunt"},{"id":"elegy_for_the_end"}],"artifacts":[["blizzard_strayer"],["noblesse_oblige","blizzard_strayer"],["emblem_of_severed_fate"],["noblesse_oblige","blizzard_strayer","+18%_atk_set","emblem_of_severed_fate"],["noblesse_oblige"]],"mainStats":{"sands":["ATK%","Energy Recharge"],"goblet":["Cryo DMG"],"circlet":["Crit Rate","DMG"]},"subStats":["Energy Recharge (until needed)","Crit Rate / DMG","ATK%","Elemental Mastery (on a non Freeze comp)","Flat ATK"],"talent":["Burst","Skill","Normal Attack"],"tip":"When using her Elemental Burst, place her Elemental Skill in the AoE to taunt and keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.\n\nMake sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage and her explosion damage as they both regen energy for her ult.","note":"An Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage. \n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:\nPrototype Crescent: </b>This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.<b>\nElegy for the End: </b>Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): </b>This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4):</b> This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%.","name":"OFF-FIELD DPS"}]}
